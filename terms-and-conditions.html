    <h1><a name="IP">Right to return a job unexecuted and uninvoiced.</a></h1>
  </header>
  <p>Due to the vagueries of existing source code, and other uncertainties, Barricane Technology Ltd. reserves the right to return any job unaccomplished and uninvoiced.</p>
  <p>To date, we have never had to do this.  This condition exists solely to prevent us having to spend a hundred hours completing work for which we had mistakenly quoted one hour, being ignorant of the true implied scope of work.</p>
