    <h1><a name="prices">Prices</a></h1>
  </header>
  <p>Our standard labour rate is Â£31.50 (around $45.00) per hour, rounded to the nearest six-minute interval (0.1 of an hour).  (Effective from 01/01/2012 - 31/12/2012.)</p>
  <p>Travel is charged at 38p per mile.</p>
  <p>We are happy to work on either a 'time-and-materials' basis, or produce fixed-price-quotes.</p>
  <p>For projects of more than 20 hours, we will insist on completing the first milestone on a 'time-and-materials' basis, so that we can quote accurately for the remainder of the project.</p>

    <h1><a name="IP">Right to return a job unexecuted and uninvoiced.</a></h1>
  </header>
  <p>Due to the vaguaries of existing source code, and other uncertainties, Barricane Technology Ltd. reserves the right to return any job unaccomplished and uninvoiced.</p>
  <p>To date, we have never had to do this.</p>

    <h1><a name="open-source">Open Source Software</a></h1>
  </header>
  <p>During the discharge of our duties to customers, we may have occasion to improve or fix the code in one or more open-source projects.</p>
  <p>Unless a customer makes known their objection, we will push any changes upstream for inclusion within these open-source projects.

    <h1><a name="IP">Payment Terms</a></h1>
  </header>
  <p>All payment in Pounds Sterling (GBP), please.  All figures in other currencies (typically USD) are indicative only.</p>
  <p>Our standard terms for projects under ten hours are 'net 30 days from date of invoice'.
  </p>
  <p>For larger projects 'payment upon milestone completion' is our normal method of working.
  </p>
  <p>We will typically set milestones at rough intervals around eight to sixteen hours' work.  Invoices will only accompany delivered milestones.  (i.e. "here are features X, Y and Z and an invoice", rather than "here's an invoice - we're still working on your project, but have nothing to show".)
  </p>
  <p>Milestones allows our customers to quickly see if there are any major misunderstandings - it's far better to have headed in the wrong direction for a few hours, than for weeks.

    <h1><a name="Change of Scope">Change of Scope</a></h1>
  </header>
  <p>Around 10%-20% of our projects undergo a major customer rethink - often invalidating days of work that has been completed to the customer's original specification.  In these circumstances we will invoice for the completed (partially wasted) work, and then start work in the new scope.
  </p> 
  <p>Also related to scope, are those features that the customer would like or consider to be obvious, but which are not in the specification.  We will often implement minor changes free of charge, at our discretion.  If we are working to a fixed-price-quote, then customers should be aware that we will complete the contracted work to the agreed specification and produce an invoice *before* considering any changes.</p>
