title: Typed Javascript
---

Here's a challenge to someone good at language design, and who has time on their
 hands...
 
A new language - Typed Javascript
---------------------------------

Features:
* All correct Javascript programmes are correct Typed Javascript programmes. 
* Typed Javascript has optional types (perhaps in comments, as per Google 
  Closure, perhaps postfix as example below).
* Typed Javascript can be compiled into native binaries.
* Compiled Typed Javascript programmes are no more than twice as slow as their 
  C or Java counterparts.
* Typed Javascript can be (trivially) translated to Javascript.
  
Can anyone pick up this idea and run with it?
