Basically, until I've developed virt-web (a web-based version of <a href='http://virt-manager.et.redhat.com/screenshots.html'>virt-manager</a>), users will need to use <a href='http://virt-manager.et.redhat.com/screenshots.html'>virt-manager</a> from a local linux/unix machine to setup and monitor their VMs. (Available in Fedora, Redhat and Ubuntu repositories, at the very least.)  

<a href='http://linux.die.net/man/1/virsh'>Virsh</a> will also be available.
