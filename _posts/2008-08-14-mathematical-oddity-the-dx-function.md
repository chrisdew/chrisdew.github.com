title: mathematical oddity, the d(x) function
created: 1218716772

Let there be a function d(x) which returns the smallest integer which can be divided exactly by all the integers from 1..x.

For example: d(1) = 1, d(2) = 2, d(3) = 6, d(4) = 12, d(5) = 60, d(6) = 60, d(7) = 210

The strange thing is that as x -> infinity, d(x) -> e**x, IIRC.

Why?

I'll give an example python programme in the <a href='/node/11'>next blog entry</a>.
