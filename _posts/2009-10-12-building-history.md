<a href='http://www.buildinghistory.org.uk/'>Building History</a> is a newly-launched collaborative project, tasked with producing freely available information about the history of the UK's towns, roads and buildings.

Building History is a wiki. Articles are created in plain text with special tags inserted where needed to present the page in a clear and readable format. There's no need to learn web design or HTML create and edit articles. The Formatting Guide of the help section has information on how to format pages.
