As I'm just getting started with git and Redmine - I thought I'd start making a list if the sites which I had found to be useful.
<ul>
<li>http://www.redmine.org/boards/2/topics/show/2821</li>
<li>http://ozmm.org/posts/git_post_commit_for_profit.html</li>
<li>http://scie.nti.st/2007/11/14/hosting-git-repositories-the-easy-and-secure-way</li>
<li>http://www.redmine.org/boards/1/topics/show/1702</li>
</ul>
