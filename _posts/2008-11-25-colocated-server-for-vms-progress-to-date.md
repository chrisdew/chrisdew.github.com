title: Colocated Server for VMs - progress to date...

I have just placed orders for all parts, except the 1u case, cooler and PSU.

So far, I've ordered:
<ul>
<li>1x Intel Q6600 Core 2 Quad Processor - 2.40 GHz, 8MB L2 Cache</li>
<li>2x Corsair 4GB Kit (2x2GB) DDR2 800MHz/PC2-6400 XMS2 Memory Non-ECC Unbuffered</li>
<li>2x Samsung SpinPoint F1 HD103UJ 1TB Hard Drive SATAII *32MB Cache* - OEM</li>
<li>1x ASUS P5B-VM SE iG965 Socket 775 Socket onboard VGA 6 Channel Audio mATX motherboard</li>
</ul>

I'm feeling a bit unsettled about pinching pennies, but getting this spec (ready built) with ECC RAM and a Xeon is around twice the price.  

I've also arranged colocation for the 1u box, with 3TB/mo bandwidth included.

I'm going to have to <em>hacksaw</em> off the audio connector on the motherboard, as it will be too high for a 1u case.  I've done similar motherboard mutilation before, so it's not too scary.

I'm happy with the performance and stability of VMs running on my server at home - but that is a tower and the colo company only accept rack-mount cases - hence the new build.
