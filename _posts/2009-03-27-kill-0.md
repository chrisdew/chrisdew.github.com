<strong>Introduction</strong>
I must admit, after a decade of working professionally with unix/linux, that I had never encountered <code type='bash'>kill -0</code> until last week.

<strong>What does the <code>-0</code> signal do?</strong>
Nothing at all...

<strong>What is it useful for?</strong>
It returns 0 if the process exists, or 1 (and an error message on stderr) if it doesn't.  

(Strictly, it returns whether a process can accept a signal, rather than whether it exists.  Can anyone enlighten me on the difference?  Kernel processes can accept signals - I didn't know that before I tried this - what can signaling kernel processes be used for?)

It's just a much nicer way of finding out whether a particular process id exists.  Other alternatives I have seen/used include grepping through the output of <code>ps -ef</code> and checking for the existence of the appropriate directory in <code>/proc</code>. 

Have a look at my entry on <a href='http://www.finalcog.com/startup-script-pid-init.d'>startup scripts</a> for more details.

<strong>Example</strong>
<code type='bash'>
chris@chris-laptop:~$ sleep 60 &
[1] 1316
chris@chris-laptop:~$ kill -0 1316 # process id of the sleep command
chris@chris-laptop:~$ echo $?
0
chris@chris-laptop:~$ kill -0 65535 # process does not exist
bash: kill: (65535) - No such process
chris@chris-laptop:~$ echo $?
1
chris@chris-laptop:~$ sudo kill -0 27835 # a kernel process
chris@chris-laptop:~$ echo $?
0
