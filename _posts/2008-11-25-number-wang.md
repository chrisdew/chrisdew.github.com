I just raised the fact that I thought 2880 was a special number, during a conversation at work today.

The reason is: 2880 and 3360 are the sole occurrence of a saddle point in g(x) of a semi-infinite series (part of which is listed below).  That's right, exactly one saddle point in the whole of infinity, and it happens at around 2880 - I don't yet know why.

There's a pint of beer, or coffee-equivalent, for anyone who can tell me what the function f(x) is, or can give me the rule, or a programme, for producing the series ... , 1008, 1440, 1680, ...

<ul>
<li>x, f(x), g(x) = f(x)/x</li>
<li>1008, 64, 0.063492</li>
<li>1440, 84, 0.058333</li>
<li>1680, 96, 0.057143</li>
<li>2016, 112, 0.055556</li>
<li>2640, 144, 0.054545</li>
<li>2880, 144, 0.050000</li>
<li>3360, 168, 0.050000</li>
<li>3600, 176, 0.048889</li>
<li>4032, 192, 0.047619</li>
<li>5040, 192, 0.038095</li>
<li>7920, 288, 0.036364</li>
<li>9360, 336, 0.035897</li>
</ul>
