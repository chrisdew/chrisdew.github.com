title: Ludum Dare entry, but I'll take a year to write it.
---

I'm going to participate the the <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2011/09/28/announcing-october-challenge-2011/">Ludum Dare October Challenge</a>.  Unfortunately I have just 3 hours per week for game development.  I don't think there's any chance of meeting the end of the month (12 hours dev), so I'm giving myself a year (150 hours).

The game will be called Anastom, pronounced anAStom, as I have the domain and am not currently using it for anything.

It has the following design constraints:

* It must be fun.
* It must be playable within two seconds of typing www.anastom.com
* It must work in 80% of browsers (no WebGL, but 2D Canvas OK).
* It must be massively multiplayer.

I have the following ideas:

* Visibility like Roguelikes.
* 2D side scrolling platformer, but not 'twitchy'.
* Puzzles, like Castle Quest (BBC Micro).
* Solo Instances for some areas, and Group Instances for others.
* Mixture of Randomly Generated Maps and Set Pieces.
* Old-school pixellated graphics, maybe 3x or 4x upscaled.  (Quicker to design.)

Platform:

* Client: JavaScript, with Canvas and Socket.IO.
* Server: NodeJS (JavaScript) with Socket.IO and MySQL.

I'll blog on progress each and every Friday, to keep my motivation up.

Lets see how I do...
