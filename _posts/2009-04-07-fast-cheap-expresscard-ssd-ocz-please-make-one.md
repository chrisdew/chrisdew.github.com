<strong>Introduction</strong>
The expresscard interface includes one channel of PCI express, in addition to a usb connection.
I've used an OCZ vertex SSD in my laptop for the past few weeks, and I'm very pleased with the performance.

<strong>Product Spec.</strong>
After a discussion with a colleague, we came up with the following product spec.:

Streaming and random IO performance: <a href='http://www.finalcog.com/ssd-bonnie-benchmark-ocz-vertex-samsung'>same as OCZ Vertex</a>.
Form factor: Expresscard54.
Capacity: 30GB
Bootable: Yes
Datachannel: PCIe 1x, possibly using usb for booting?
Price: similar to 30GB OCZ Vertex. 

<strong>Uses</strong>
Such a drive would be a killer product for laptops.  Users can have a fast SSD for the OS, and still use their existing hard drive for videos, music and other data.

It would also allow quick OS swaps, one card for Linux, one for XP, one for Vista, etc.

Is anyone else looking for such a beast?  Please upvote on digg, reddit, etc. if you are.  Maybe we can persuade OCZ of how much money they could make on such a product :-)
