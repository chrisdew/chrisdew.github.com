title: Long Week Startup - Friday April 22th to Sunday May 2nd
---

Due to Easter and the Royal Wedding, software developers in the UK have an unrivalled opportunity to devote 11 whole days to playing **Internet Startup**.  This only costs us three days' leave from our real jobs while making it an almost certainty that we create the next Google or Facebook.  In a week.

Thanks to my very understanding wife, I will be working on Chris' Big Idea&trade; for 8 days during the long week.

Rules for Internet Startup
--------------------------

- Prepare by reading every link on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com).  Tick.
- Have a grandiose, multi-million user idea.  Tick.
- Choose to use unfamiliar, bleeding edge technologies.  Tick.
- No previous experience in running a company.  Tick.
- Be wildly optimistic and mildly delusional.  Tick.

If anyone else wants to play Internet Startup during the Long Week, [email me](/contact) or tag your tweets with #LongWeekStartups.
