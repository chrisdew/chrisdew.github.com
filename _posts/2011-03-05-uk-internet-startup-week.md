Long Week Startup - Friday April 22th to Sunday May 2nd
-------------------------------------------------------

Due to Easter and the Royal Wedding, software developers in the UK have an unrivalled opportunity to devote 11 whole days to playing Internet Startup.  This only costs us three days' leave from our real jobs.

Thanks to my very understanding wife, I will be working on Chris' Big Idea&trade; for 8 days during the long week.

Rules for Internet Startup
--------------------------

# Have a grandiose, multi-million user idea.  Tick.
# Choose to use unfamiliar, bleeding edge technologies.  Tick.
# No previous experience in running a company.  Tick.
# Be wildly optimistic and mildly delusional.  Tick.

If anyone else wants to play Internet Startup during the Long Week, [email me](/contact) or tag your tweets with #LongWeek.
