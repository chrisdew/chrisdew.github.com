title: Simple Wedding List
---

For our wedding, I hacked together a simple wedding list (bridal registry for US readers).

The driving differentiator for Simple Wedding List is that guests do not have to log in, in order to mark the gift they will get.  Security is provided through other means.

Later, I was asked to set it up again for my wife's cousin.

I'm now making [Simple Wedding List](http://www.simpleweddinglist.com) available to the public.
