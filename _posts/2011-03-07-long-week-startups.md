title: Long Week Startups - Friday April 22nd to Sunday May 2nd
---

I've had several emails from people interested in Long Week Startups.  These
have included requests for rules.  The level of interest (i.e. not none) has taken me quite by surprise.

I have create a [google group](http://groups.google.com/group/long-week-startups) and a [group-editable site](https://sites.google.com/a/barricane.com/long-week-startups/) for Long Week Startups.
