I just tried to transfer some money to our joint account, and repeatedly got this error:

<code>
Microsoft VBScript runtime  error '800a000d'

Type mismatch: 'CInt'

E:\INETPUB\WWWROOT\IBREBUILD\MOVE_MONEY\../includes/validation.asp, line 191 

</code>

on page
<code>

</code>

Should we all (their customers) be concerned that Alliance and Leicester have written their internet banking software in Visual Basic?  Or just that trivial errors get through their testing?

Please, sort yourselves out and stop using VBScript for banking.
