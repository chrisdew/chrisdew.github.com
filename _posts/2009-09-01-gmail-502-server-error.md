title: gmail - 502 Server Error
created: 1251836948

Gmail's broken, just when I need to send an email.  There have now been three occasions this year where gmail has been down for more than half an hour.

It's getting to the point where, for the first time in a few years, I'm going to start running my own mail server again.

Is there an open source system which would give me usable webmail?  I want all the features of gmail, without the outages, for free ;-)
