title: Hardware for VM hosting server.

I've decided to buy/build a new server to put in a colo facility.  It gives me much more flexibility of colo provider if I can ship a 1U box.  (UKShells colo does host towers, but they only give you 5 IPs.  If you need more, you move to a 'custom' plan which cost three times more per month.)

I'll keep the current testing (tower) server at home.

I'm now looking for hardware for the server.  I want things to be cheap, powerful and reliable.  I don't mind doing the build myself, though if an off-the shelf server is cheaper, I'll go that way.

I need:
<ul>
<li>A 1U rackmount case with at least 2xSATA hotswap drives.</li>  
<li>A motherboard which takes a QuadCore 775 processor and (initially) 4x2MB DDR2.</li>
<li>2x1.5Tb, or maybe 4x750GB/1TB SATA</li>
</ul>

Some interesting links which I've already found include:

If anyone has suggestions on hardware, please comment below...  I'm especially interested in the differences between the <a href='http://www.ebuyer.com/search?sq=1TB&store=2&cat=4&subcat=1090&sort=pricelow&limit=10&page=1&subsearch=Go'>1TB drives on ebuyer</a>.
