    <h1>What can we do to help you?</h1>
  </header>
  <p>
    We are a software and internet services company.  We specialise in small,
    low-cost projects - typically twenty hours or less.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have any form of software or internet services requirement, we will be more than happy to discuss it.  
    If we're not the right people for the job, we'll let you know.

  <p>
    Professionalism.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is what we do.  We won't go off travelling and leave you in the 
    lurch.  We don't finish university, suddenly becoming no longer able to work for you.  
  </p>
  <p>All the work which Barricane does for our customers
    is fully managed with version control and a ticketing system.  We make our
    ticketing system available to you, so that you can track our progress on
    your project.  
  </p>
  <p>All of our software developers have at least ten years experience
    in the software industry.
  </p>
  <p>Also, we have PRINCE2 qualified staff, in case that is your sort of thing.</p>

    We're UK based.  If you like, we can visit you to discuss your requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our UK timezone and our extended working day, allows us to be available 
    for the whole of the East and West coast US working days, while also allowing a significant overlap with the Middle and Far East.
