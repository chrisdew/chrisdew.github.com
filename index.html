    <h1>What can we do to help you?</h1>
    <p>
      We are a software and internet services company.  We specialise in small,
      low-cost projects, of typically ten hours or less.
    </p>
    <h2>Why hire Barricane, rather than my boss's mate's nephew?</h2>
    <p>
      Professionalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is what we do.  We won't go off travelling and leave you in the 
      lurch.  We don't finish university, suddenly becoming no longer able to work for you.  All of our software developers have at least ten years experience
      in the software industry.
    </p>
    <p>All the work which Barricane does for our customers
      is fully managed with version control and a ticketing system.  We make our
      ticketing system available to you, so that you can track our progress on
      your project.  
    </p>
    <h2>Why hire Barricane, rather than a far-eastern freelancer?</h2>
    <p>
      We're UK based.  If you like, we can visit you to discuss your requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our UK timezone and our extended working day, allows us to be available 
      for the whole of the East and West coast US working days.

      Did we say we specialised in small projects?
