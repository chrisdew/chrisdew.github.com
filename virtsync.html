  <p>
    VirtSync is an rsync-like command line tool for synchronizing large, sparse, virtual machine disk images.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Why use sparse virtual machine disk images?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file">sparse files</a> for Virtual machine disk images can result in huge space savings.  A 100GB VM disk, which is 5% full will only use 5GB of disk space as a sparse file, but 100GB if the disk image file is not sparse.
  </p>
  <h2>
    What does VirtSync do that rsync can't?
  </h2>
  <p>
    rsync does not allow the 'sparse' and 'inplace' switches to be used together.  You must choose between:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>sparse - this allows large-sized files to occupy a small amount of disk space, but the file is wastefully rewritten to disk each time.</li>
    <li>inplace - the synchronised file is efficiently updated inplace, but will occupy a large amount of disk space.</li> 
  </ul>
  <p>VirtSync gives you both for a $50 per server, one-off, licensing fee.</p>
